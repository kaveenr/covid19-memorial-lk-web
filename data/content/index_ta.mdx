<h2 className="card-title">{total} people have died due to the pandemic in Sri Lanka</h2> 

<p>Through this memorial, we hope to remember them as more than numbers; they are civilians and healthcare workers; spouses, siblings, parents, children, friends and loved ones. Each individual has their own story, and leaves behind a unique legacy.</p>

<p>We have so far documented the details of <b>{count}</b> people and will continue to add them as we find more details.</p>

<p><i>Each flower represents one person and shares their age, sex and where they are from, as recorded by the government.</i></p>
