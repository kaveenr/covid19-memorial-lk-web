More than 13,000 people have died due to COVID-19 in Sri Lanka.Through the Sri Lanka Covid-19 Memorial we hope to remember them as more than numbers; they are civilians and healthcare workers; spouses, siblings, parents, children, friends and loved ones. Each individual has their own story, and leaves behind a unique legacy.

Please fill this form if you wish to submit details of loved ones to the memorial. Please share the form with others who might want to do the same.
